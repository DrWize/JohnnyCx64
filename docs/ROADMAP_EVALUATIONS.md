# Roadmap evaluations: CRT, fidelity, and cross-platform scope

Updated: 2026-07-16

## Phase 5 — optional CRT modes

### CRT-Easymode

The upstream shader describes itself as a flat CRT shader intended for 1080p or
higher output. Its beam, mask, gamma, brightness, and sharpness controls fit the
intended high-resolution role. However, its source header states only
`License: GPL` without identifying a GPL version or an `or later` option.

Decision: do not copy, port, or distribute CRT-Easymode until its license version
is clarified by an authoritative source. Technical suitability does not resolve
ambiguous redistribution terms.

Primary source:
[libretro CRT-Easymode shader](https://github.com/libretro/glsl-shaders/blob/master/crt/shaders/crt-easymode.glsl).

### CRT-Geom

CRT-Geom explicitly permits redistribution under GPL version 2 or later, which
is compatible with this GPLv3-or-later project. It provides curvature, rounded
corners, overscan, tilt, dot-mask, gamma, saturation, and optional interlace
simulation. The feature set is materially larger than the current single-pass
flat modes and overlaps the already available Lottes option.

Decision: technically and legally viable, but do not retain a port yet. A curved
mode is optional rather than a release requirement, and the incomplete physical
performance matrix cannot establish its cost or default parameters. If it is
prototyped later, interlace must default off and the port must preserve the
upstream copyright and GPL-2.0-or-later notice.

[libretro CRT-Geom shader](https://github.com/libretro/glsl-shaders/blob/master/crt/shaders/crt-geom.glsl).

### Phase 5 outcome

No additional CRT emulation shader is retained. Off, Lightweight, Fast, and
Lottes remain the CRT set. This avoids adding an ambiguously licensed mode or an
unmeasured curved mode merely to increase the option count. The later custom
HDR Pop filter is a separate large-screen display enhancement, not a CRT
emulation or an import of either evaluated shader.

## Phase 6 — missing effects and fidelity

`FLAME.BMP` and `FLURRY.BMP` are absent from both verified original archives and
the reviewed public implementations. The engine already treats them as optional
so `FIRE.TTM` and Full Story continue safely.

Decision: keep the effects omitted and documented for the stable release. Do not
present generated or newly drawn images as recovered original assets. A future
replacement is acceptable only when it is original work, has documented
authorship and redistribution terms, is clearly labeled as a replacement, and
can be disabled for original-data fidelity comparisons.

Remaining fidelity work is observational: representative-scene screenshots,
long-run order and timing, day/night changes, holidays, and known engine edge
cases must be recorded without downloading or redistributing copyrighted video
or game assets.

## Phase 7 — cross-platform scope

Linux was evaluated as the first possible additional platform, and a temporary
compile proof established that the Go/Raylib code could be built on Ubuntu with
a small platform boundary. It did not establish runtime display, audio,
packaging, idle detection, or XScreenSaver support.

Decision: keep JohnnyCx64 Windows-only. Remove the Linux platform shim and
Ubuntu CI workflow so a compile-only artifact does not imply support or consume
project build time. Reconsider cross-platform work only with a complete runtime,
screensaver integration, packaging, and QA plan.
